# Module1-Projects
Hi everyone, Zemeng here.
Module 1 includes ApplePicker, Mission Demolition, and my prototype.

ApplePicker is an advanced version, which you are able to move both vertically and horizontally. It's almost impossible to lose that game.
Mission Demolition is regular, but I have some unique designs on the castle.
The prototype is a combination of Mission Demolition and Roll a Ball. The player is now able to launch from the shooter and collect pickups along the way. There is a 2d to 3d change with the camera. Players can also jump when they hit any wall or ground. If you find out you keep switching views of the game when you click "Space", just click anywhere on the screen to solve that. You might hit the switch view after shooting, which ends up pressing the button using "space" instead of jumping. Other than this, hope you enjoy this game!
Feel free if you have any comments or suggestions!
